## How to run

## Current Task
### Timeline
Milestone, Target Date,	Description
1. Project Setup & Requirements, **Mar 21**, Finalize scope, roles, and set up repository/environment.
2. Map & Routing Implementation, **Mar 28**, Convert RoadSegment dictionary to graph form; implement & test routing.
3. Trajectory Generation Prototype, **April 1**, Implement optimization-based planner to follow lane boundaries & speed limits on a single segment.
4. Integration w/ Localization, **April 3**, Add EKF-based sensor fusion & integrate real-time updates into the planner.
5. Full-Stack Simulation, **April 7**, Combine routing, motion planning, and localization.
6. Testing & Debugging, **April 13**, Refine trajectory generation; ensure correct stops at stop signs/loading zones.
7. Final Demo & Documentation, **April 17**, Complete final demonstration, produce project documentation, and wrap up.

## Current Issue
1. PKG added Interpolations, whether it is viable
2. PID countrol not realized, but relied on the speed limit
3. PKG added StaticsArray, whether it is viable
